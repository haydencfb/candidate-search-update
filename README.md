  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## This application uses the GitHub API to allow the user to cycle through random groupings of users from GitHub's database and allows the user to select or reject them in hunt of an employee, a partner, an employer, etc.

  - My motivation for this project was to learn how to work with APIs as well as how to better develop within react.
  - I built this project as it helped improve my skills in typescript, improved my skills in developing with APIs, and greatly tested and improved my patience, as working with these APIs can be difficult and mentally taxing. 
  - This candidate search board solves the issues that employers may have when searching for applications for an open position, as it allows them to see deal-breaking information from the beginning and allows them to better select a worthy candidate.
  - I learned how to work with the GitHub API and got a better understanding of making certain requests, such as get, fetch, and working with async/await functions.
